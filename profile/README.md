### 1) folk ü™∂ manifesto

#### why

Honors the derivative history of Signature economies: 

1) [Declaration of Interdependence](https://www.interdependence.online/declaration)
2) [Towards a Digital Pluriverse](https://pluriverse.world/)
3) [Signature Economies](https://sign.kernel.community)

It's a priority of [Pluriverse.wtf](https://pluriverse.wtf) to publish a Signature economies manifesto forked from what we build at folk.

Important to announce folk values in Web3.

#### repo

[A fork](https://github.com/forkfolk/manifesto) of KERNEL's Signature Economies.

### 2) karaoke üìñ songbook

#### why

* covers of songs are one of the few permissionless areas of copyright
    * ripe to explore Signature economies 
* fewer owners of songwriter share than other parts of the song vertical
    * a performer memorizing lyrics is an ancient form of Signature economies (seal)
* text is the universal interface
    * from Unix pipes to lootverse to cuniform
* expresses the poetic nature of beautiful lyrics
    *  honor carefully chosen words songwriters share in honest vulnerability

*Sing in tune with the tuning fork.* #tuningfolk

### 3) blog üóûÔ∏è & üìª podcast

#### why

Folk has a rich history. 

Folk's ongoing connection to the open source software movement has deep roots.

Folk's ongoing connection to copyright legislation and enforcement has deep roots.

Folk's relationship with emerging network techologies such as AI are fascinating to explore.

### 4) public goods üèûÔ∏è for pluriverse 

#### why

[Pluriverse.wtf](https://pluriverse.wtf) is building lore rooted in the same community as KERNEL.

The lore lends itself to the Signature economies and multimedia of folk.
